# UX Journal 1 - New Printer Experience

## Kyle Handy, 03/04/2021

  For my first Journal, I decided to document my exeriences with a printer. I had a very old printer for a long time but actually just got a brand new one a few days ago. Since printers are notorious for being hard to work with, I thought this would be a good opportinuty to see if newer printers solve any issues that have been prevalent with older versions for some time. The printer is currently still in the box, so I will document my interactions with setting up the printer for the first time, the actual printing, and issues that pop up along the way.
  
  The printer I will be unpacking and setting up is the Epson EcoTank ET-2760. A picture of the front of the box is shown below:
