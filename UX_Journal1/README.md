# UX Journal 1 - New Printer Experience

## Kyle Handy, 03/04/2021

For my first Journal, I decided to document my exeriences with a printer. I had a very old printer for a long time but actually just got a brand new one a few days ago. Since printers are notorious for being hard to work with, I thought this would be a good opportinuty to see if newer printers solve any issues that have been prevalent with older versions for some time. The printer is currently still in the box, so I will be able to document the entire experience with the printer, from set up to printing. My goal for this interaction is to successfully set up the printer, print a few pages, and document any issues that occur througout the process. Some issues I have noticed with older printers that I will be looking out for are how the ink is inserted and how long it lasts, printing wirelessly (ie. through bluetooth or wifi), and how long the set up takes. It is worth noting that I have set up a couple printers before, so I would consider myself an experienced user in this problem space.
  
The printer I will be unpacking and setting up is the Epson EcoTank ET-2760. A picture of the front of the box is shown below:

And here is a picture of the printer once it was taken out of the box:

On the box the printer states that it has easy to fill ink, two sided printing, and easy wireless printing, so I will be looking out for these features as I go along as well since they seem to be the biggest appeal of this printer.

My first impressions of the UI were good, it does not look overly complicated and the printer has a sleek design. However, beginning the set up process I immediatly noticed that the instructions were much larger than I anticipated. Here is the front and back of the instructions for set up page:

In my experiences, when setting up a printer typically you put in the ink cartridge, plug in the printer, and download the necessary software on the device you want to print from. It is the same for this printer, however the steps ended up being more complicated than other printers I have set up. The ink is not a cartridge for this printer but rather it is bottles of ink which you dispense into 'filling ports'. Once all of the different colors are put into the appropriate ports, then you have to turn the printer on and let the ink 'charge' which takes about ten minutes. This seemed odd to me at first, but I read about it and it supposedly makes the ink last much longer than the old cartridge system did. Ink going fast was a huge probelm with old printers, so if the extra hassel of putting each color in individually and waiting 10 minutes for it to charge really makes a difference, then I believe it a tradeoff worth making. I attached below some images of me inserting the ink, which show how this new system works:
