# UX Journal 1 - New Printer Experience

## Kyle Handy, 03/04/2021

For my first Journal, I decided to document an interaction with my printer. A couple days ago I bought a brand new printer and figured it would be perfect to document my experience setting it up. Printers are notorious for being hard to work with, so I thought it would be interesting to see if a newly released model would fix some prevalent issues that have been around for a while. I will be specifically looking out for the **error tolerance** of this printer as it seems like the biggest area for improvement for printers in general. The **error tolerance** of this printer refers to how resilient it is to human errors. It is worth noting that I have set up several printers for friends and family over the years, so I would consider myself an experienced user in this problem space. My goal is to determine if this printer has good **error tolerance** and to document the troubles I have setting it up.

Here is a picture of the printer I will be unboxing and setting up, it is a Epson EcoTank ET-2760:

My first impressions of the user interface and the printer in general were good. The design looks sleek and the UI is simple. Here is a picture of the printer outside the box:

Even though it's a brand new printer, I still ran into a problem setting it up. Everything worked smoothly up to the point where I had to set up the wireless printing. As a computer science student I am confident when setting up new technology like this and can usually work around any issues that arise, but this one I could not. Setting up the wireless printing would not work, I tried all the work arounds they said on the Epson website and still it did not work. Other than this one issue, setting up the printer was a breeze and definitely easier than other models I have set up.

Overall, I would say that the **error tolerance** of this printer is better than those I have worked with in the past, but still could use some improvements. The set up and actual printing is simple and easy to do, however setting up certain features such as wireless printing is still subject to lots of errors.
