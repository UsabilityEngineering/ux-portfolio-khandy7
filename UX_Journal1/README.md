# UX Journal 1 - New Printer Experience

## Kyle Handy, 03/04/2021

For my first Journal, I decided to document my exeriences with a printer. I had a very old printer for a long time but actually just got a brand new one a few days ago. Since printers are notorious for being hard to work with, I thought this would be a good opportinuty to see if newer printers solve any issues that have been prevalent with older versions for some time. The printer is currently still in the box, so I will be able to document the entire experience with the printer, from set up to printing. My goal for this interaction is to successfully set up the printer, print a few pages, and document any issues that occur througout the process. It is worth noting that I have set up a couple printers before, so I would consider myself an experienced user.
  
The printer I will be unpacking and setting up is the Epson EcoTank ET-2760. A picture of the front of the box is shown below:

And here is a picture of the actual once it was taken out of the box:
