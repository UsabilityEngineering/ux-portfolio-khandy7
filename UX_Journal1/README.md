# UX Journal 1 - New Printer Experience

## Kyle Handy, 03/04/2021

  For my first Journal, I decided to document my exeriences with a printer. I had a very old printer for a long time but actually just got a brand new one a few days ago. Since printers are notorious for being hard to work with, I thought this would be a good opportinuty to see if newer printers solve any issues that have been prevalent with older versions for some time. The printer is currently still in the box, so I will be able to document the entire experience with the printer, from set up to printing. My goal for this interaction is to successfully set up the printer, print a few pages, and document any issues that occur througout the process. Some issues I have noticed with older printers that I will be looking out for are how the ink is inserted and how long it lasts, printing wirelessly (ie. through bluetooth or wifi), and how long the set up takes. I will also be looking out for the overall **error tolerance** of this printer since printers generally run into lots of errors. It is worth noting that I have set up a couple printers before, so I would consider myself an experienced user in this problem space.
  
The printer I will be unpacking and setting up is the Epson EcoTank ET-2760. A picture of the front of the box is shown below:

And here is a picture of the printer once it was taken out of the box:

  On the box the printer states that it has easy to fill ink, two sided printing, and easy wireless printing, so I will be looking out for these features as I go along as well since they seem to be the biggest appeal of this printer.

  My first impressions of the UI were good, it does not look overly complicated and the printer has a sleek design. However, beginning the set up process I immediatly noticed that the instructions were much larger than I anticipated. Here is the front and back of the instructions page:

  In my experiences, when setting up a printer typically you put in the ink cartridge, plug in the printer, and download the necessary software on the device you want to print from. It is the same for this printer, however the steps ended up being more complicated than other printers I have set up. The ink is not a cartridge for this printer but rather it is bottles of ink which you dispense into 'filling ports'. Once all of the different colors are put into the appropriate ports, then you have to turn the printer on and let the ink 'charge' which takes about ten minutes. This seemed odd to me at first, but I read about it and it supposedly makes the ink last much longer than the old cartridge system did. Ink going fast was a huge problem with old printers, so if the extra hassel of putting each color in individually and waiting 10 minutes for it to charge really makes a difference, then I believe it is a tradeoff worth making. I attached below an image of me inserting the ink, which show how this new system works:

  The biggest problem I have with this new way of inserting ink is not the time it takes, but rather the way they designed how it works. In the above picture, you can see I have to stay and hold up the scanner which covers the ink ports as the ink is inserted, otherwise the lid hits the ink bottle out of place. This made the inserting of the ink much more annoying as I had to sit there and watch them all individually fill up while I held the lid in place. This annoyance could have easily been avoided with an additional small piece, like a kickstand of some sort for the lid. Small things like this make the **satisfaction** of using a new piece of technology much lower. Instead of being excited over my new printer, I was bothered that I had to sit there and hold a piece up while waiting for the ink to fill.
  
  After filling up the ink, I turned the printer on and started setting up the software. The interface on the small screen of the printer is quite well thought out. There are arrows to navigate the different options and an OK button to select which one you need to use. The other useful buttons include the back button, the home button, and the question mark button which helps you if you are confused. I found the UI, for the most part, very easy to deal with. However, there is one part of it that caused me some problems. The other two buttons on the right, an upside down triangle and a straight line, are used for some prompts when the other buttons are already mapped to something else. I think this design would be fine, however the symbols on the buttons do not seem to really make sense with what they are used for. On some screens I would press OK to move on, some I would have press the straight line button to move on. The same thing with the triangle and the undo button, they seemed to randomlly switch functions with each other. I feel like if they chose symbols that made more sense with the function of the button (maybe a check mark for the straight line and an X for the triangle), the UI would be easier to deal with. Below is a picture of the straight line and triangle buttons:
