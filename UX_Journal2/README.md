# UX Journal 2 - Coffee Machine Experience

## Kyle Handy, 04/16/2021

For this journal, I decided to document my experience with my coffee machine. I got a new Keurig coffee machine a few months and have enjoyed using it so far, so I thought I would examine the **learnability** and **efficiency** of it. The model of Keurig I have is the Keurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker.

Here is a full view picture of the coffee machine.

This model of Keurig allows brewing coffee in both single cups and pots of coffee. Here is a top view to see where the coffee would go.
