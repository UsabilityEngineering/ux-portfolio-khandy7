# UX Journal 2 - Coffee Machine Experience

## Kyle Handy, 04/16/2021

For this journal, I decided to document my experience with my coffee machine. I got a new Keurig coffee machine a few months and have enjoyed using it so far, so I thought I would examine the **learnability** and **efficiency** of it. The model of Keurig I have is the Keurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker.

The two pictures above show the general design of the coffee machine. The left picture is the full view of the machine and the right picture is a top view to show the UI and where the coffee goes.
