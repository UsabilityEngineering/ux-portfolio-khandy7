# UX Journal 2 - Coffee Machine Experience

## Kyle Handy, 04/16/2021

For this journal, I decided to document my experience with my coffee machine. I got a new Keurig coffee machine a few months ago and have enjoyed using it so far, so I thought I would analyze an interaction with it. My goal for this interaction is to document the **learnability** and **efficiency** of this coffee machine. The model of Keurig I have is the Keurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker.

Here is a picture of the machine to show the general design.

Here is a picture of the top view, it shows the UI and where the coffee goes. This machine allows you to make either single cups of coffee using a pod or make entire pots of coffee. The two bottom buttons are how you decide which type of coffee you would like to make.

To start this interaction, I emptied the water container and all coffee in the machine to see how it would handle it. Once everything was emptied, I turned the machine on and went about making a cup of coffee. Immediately, the machine let me know that it needed water in order to continue, here is a picture of what it looked like.
